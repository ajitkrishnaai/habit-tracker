# PRD: Personal Habit Tracker App

## Introduction/Overview

The Personal Habit Tracker is a web application designed to help individuals track daily habits and build consistency through an easy-to-use nightly check-in process. The app addresses the common problem of maintaining accountability for personal habits by providing a simple interface for daily logging, reflection, and progress visualization. The primary goal is to create a sustainable habit-tracking routine that encourages consistency through clear feedback and streak tracking.

## Goals

1. **Simplify Daily Habit Tracking**: Provide a one-click interface for marking habits as complete/incomplete each day
2. **Encourage Consistency**: Use visual feedback (streaks, percentages) to motivate continued habit completion
3. **Enable Reflection**: Allow users to capture daily thoughts and feelings about their habit performance
4. **Provide Progress Insights**: Display meaningful statistics about habit completion patterns over time
5. **Support Flexible Habit Management**: Allow users to create and customize their own habit list

## User Stories

**As a habit tracker user, I want to:**

- Quickly mark my daily habits as done/not done so I can complete my nightly routine efficiently
- See today's date clearly so I know I'm logging the correct day
- Add a brief reflection about my day so I can process my feelings about my habit performance
- View my streak counts so I feel motivated to maintain consistency
- See my completion percentages so I understand my overall progress
- Add new habits as my goals evolve so the app grows with my needs
- View all my historical data so I can see long-term patterns

## Functional Requirements

### Core Habit Tracking
1. The system must display today's date prominently on the main interface
2. The system must show a list of all active habits with clear "Done" / "Not Done" buttons
3. The system must allow users to mark each habit as completed or not completed for the current day
4. The system must prevent users from modifying past days' entries
5. The system must save habit completion status immediately when clicked

### Custom Habit Management
6. The system must allow users to create new habits with custom names
7. The system must allow users to edit existing habit names
8. The system must allow users to delete habits they no longer want to track
9. The system must handle habit deletion gracefully (preserve historical data but stop tracking)

### Daily Reflection
10. The system must provide a text input field for daily reflection after habit completion
11. The system must allow reflections of up to 500 characters
12. The system must save reflections and associate them with the current date
13. The system must allow users to view past reflections alongside habit data

### Progress Feedback
14. The system must calculate and display current streak for each habit
15. The system must calculate and display overall completion percentage for each habit
16. The system must show completion statistics for configurable time periods (week, month, all-time)
17. The system must reset streaks when a habit is missed (based on calendar days)
18. The system must display a summary view after submitting daily habits

### Data Management
19. The system must store all habit data in Firebase Firestore cloud database
20. The system must persist data across devices and browser sessions
21. The system must provide an export function for habit data (JSON format)
22. The system must handle data gracefully with offline persistence and sync when online
23. The system must use Firebase Anonymous Authentication for secure data access
24. The system must provide real-time data synchronization across devices

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Social features**: No sharing, friends, or community aspects
- **Social features**: No sharing, friends, or community aspects
- **Reminders/notifications**: No push notifications or email reminders
- **Complex scheduling**: Only daily habits, no weekly/monthly or custom frequencies
- **Habit categories**: Simple flat list without grouping or tagging
- **Advanced analytics**: No trends, correlations, or predictive insights
- **User authentication**: No login system or user accounts
- **Mobile app**: Web-only, though should work on mobile browsers

## Design Considerations

### User Interface
- **Mobile-first responsive design**: Primary usage will be on mobile during nightly routine
- **Large, easy-to-tap buttons**: Accommodate usage in low-light conditions
- **Minimal, clean interface**: Reduce cognitive load during nightly check-in
- **Clear visual hierarchy**: Today's date and habit list should be immediately obvious
- **Accessible color scheme**: High contrast for visibility in various lighting

### User Experience Flow
1. User opens app in evening
2. Sees today's date and list of habits
3. Taps through each habit (Done/Not Done)
4. Writes brief reflection in text area
5. Submits and sees progress summary
6. Optionally reviews streaks and percentages

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack Recommendations
- **Frontend**: React or Vue.js for component-based UI
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore for cloud data storage
- **Authentication**: Firebase Anonymous Authentication
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS or Tailwind for responsive design
- **Build Tool**: Vite or Create React App for development workflow

### Data Structure
- **Firestore Collections**:
  - `users/{userId}/habits`: `{id, name, createdDate, isActive, order}`
  - `users/{userId}/entries`: `{id, date, habitId, completed, reflection, timestamp}`
- **Anonymous Authentication**: Each user gets a unique Firebase UID
- **Offline Persistence**: Firebase caches data locally for offline access
- Should support efficient Firestore queries for streak and percentage calculations

### Performance
- App should load quickly (under 2 seconds)
- Habit marking should provide immediate visual feedback with optimistic updates
- Firebase offline persistence should enable instant interactions when offline
- Data sync should happen seamlessly in the background
- Data export should handle large datasets efficiently from Firestore

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Daily usage consistency**: Aim for user to complete check-in 5+ days per week
- **Session duration**: Average session should be 2-5 minutes (efficient workflow)
- **Habit completion rate**: Track overall percentage of habits marked as done

### Feature Adoption
- **Reflection usage**: 70%+ of daily check-ins should include written reflection
- **Custom habit creation**: Users should create 3-7 personal habits on average
- **Data export usage**: Track how often users export their data

### Technical Performance
- **Load time**: App should load in under 2 seconds on mobile
- **Data persistence**: Zero data loss during normal browser usage
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Works in Chrome, Safari, Firefox

## Open Questions

1. **Streak grace periods**: Should there be any forgiveness for missed days (e.g., sick days)?
2. **Habit archiving**: How should completed/discontinued habits be handled in the interface?
3. **Data backup prompts**: Should the app remind users to export data periodically?
4. **Time zone handling**: How should the app handle travel across time zones?
5. **Habit completion timing**: Should there be a cutoff time for marking previous day's habits?
6. **Progress visualization**: What specific charts or visual elements would be most motivating?
7. **Onboarding flow**: Should there be guided setup for first-time users?
